# Getting started

## Server setup

To get a feel for the UI, you can poke around a public dist test server operated by Cloudera at [http://dist-test.cloudera.org](http://dist-test.cloudera.org).
However, test submission requires authentication.

You can run your own isolate server, `dist_test` server, slave, beanstalkd, and MySQL instance to try this out locally.

https://github.com/apache/incubator-kudu/blob/master/build-support/dist_test.py

### Docker-based setup

You can use [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) for ease of setting up dist_test.
This setup depends on [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/).
Please also refer to the documentation of [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/).

Start containers (`mysql`, `beanstalk`, `isolate`, `master`, `worker`, and `client`) with your AWS credential:

        $ export AWS_ACCESS_KEY=foo AWS_SECRET_KEY=bar TEST_RESULT_BUCKET=your-s3-bucket
        $ docker-compose up

Then you can execute [a grind test](#client-setup) in the client container:

        $ docker exec disttest_client_1 sh -c 'cd grind/python/disttest/test/test-resources/MultiModuleTestProject && grind test'
		
You can access the master UI via `http://localhost:8081/`.

### Manual setup
If you do not want to use Docker for setting up, you can set up the environment manually.

The first step is to clone and build the required following additional repos we need.

Luci is split into [luci-py](https://github.com/luci/luci-py) and [luci-go](https://github.com/luci/luci-go).
Luci doesn't have releases, so for reference, here are the commit hashes we use:

luci-py:

        commit 1f8ba359e84dc7f26b1ba286dfb4e28674efbff4
        Author: Marc-Antoine Ruel <maruel@chromium.org>
        Date:   Tue Nov 4 15:55:03 2014 -0500

            Add isolate.py archive --blacklist and remove stale chromium blacklist.

            - Remove stale default blacklist that are not relevant anymore. This further
              cleans up the client code from chromium-specific code.
            - Make isolate.py and isolateserver.py use the same default blacklist. Sanity.

Follow the luci-go README for installation instructions.
This requires Go 1.4. 1.5 and higher will fail with an error about "use of internal package not allowed".
Due to the lack of version pinning that is typical of Go dependency management, the details are left as an exercise for the reader :)

Once that's complete, start an [isolateserver](https://isolateserver.appspot.com/).

Next, create a configuration file at `~/.dist_test.cnf` that looks like the following:

        [isolate]
        home=/home/andrew/dev/luci-py/client
        server=http://localhost:4242
        cache_dir=/tmp/isolate-cache

        [aws]
        access_key=<FILL IN HERE>
        secret_key=<FILL IN HERE>
        test_result_bucket=<FILL IN HERE>

        [mysql]
        host=localhost
        user=<FILL IN HERE>
        password=<FILL IN HERE>
        database=<FILL IN HERE>

        [beanstalk]
        host=localhost

        [dist_test]
        master=http://localhost:8081/
        allowed_ip_ranges=0.0.0.0/0

Adjust `isolate.home` to point within your luci-py repo. The client folder should have a `run_isolated.py` file that is the key functionality we're using.

Note that as part of this, you need to setup an AWS account to store test results, and also a MySQL instance running with a configured user/password and database.

Start beanstalk:

        $ beanstalkd

Start the master and one or more slaves:

        $ ./bin/server
        $ ./bin/slave

`dist_test` will create the required tables in MySQL on first run.

## Client setup

Now, we are ready to submit our first job.
`dist_test` supports multiple frontends, but the easiest to get started with is `grind`.
`grind` is the `dist_test` frontend for Maven + Surefire + JUnit based projects, and includes a sample project that we can build and test.

Call `setup.sh` to create `env/grind.cfg`. This defaults to the `cloudera.org` isolate server and `dist_test` server; change these to localhost.
The paths are autogenerated and will be correct for your installation:

        [grind]
        isolate_server = http://localhost:4242
        dist_test_client_path = /home/andrew/dev/dist_test/bin/client
        dist_test_master = http://localhost:8081
        grind_cache_dir = /home/andrew/dev/dist_test/env/.grind/cache
        grind_temp_dir = /home/andrew/dev/dist_test/env/.grind/temp
        isolate_path = /home/andrew/dev/dist_test/bin/isolate
        dist_test_password = 
        dist_test_user = 

Now, perform the following:

        $ export PATH=`pwd`/grind/bin:$PATH
        $ export GRINDCFG=`pwd`/env/grind.cfg
        $ cd grind/python/disttest/test/test-resources/MultiModuleTestProject
        $ mvn clean package -DskipTests
        $ grind -c $GRINDCFG test

If this succeeds, you should see a message like this with progress report:

        INFO:__main__:Calling /home/andrew/dev/dist_test/bin/client submit --name MultiModuleTestProject /home/andrew/dev/dist_test/env/.grind/temp/grind.qSIM9d/run.json
        INFO:dist_test.client:Submitting job to http://localhost:8081/submit_job
        INFO:dist_test.client:Submitted job MultiModuleTestProject.andrew.1461116518.30580
        INFO:dist_test.client:Watch your results at http://localhost:8081/job?job_id=MultiModuleTestProject.andrew.1461116518.30580
        0.5s    0/5 tests complete

Click on the job status page URL to watch progress. It's normal for the test run to fail, since some of the included tests are intended to always fail.

# Additional resources

More detailed information about `dist_test` and `grind` can be found in the included project documentation:

* [docs/dist_test.md](dist_test.md)
* [docs/grind.md](grind.md)

The Apache Kudu repository also has an example of a C++ / gtest `dist_test` frontend at [build-support/dist-test.py](https://github.com/apache/incubator-kudu/blob/master/build-support/dist_test.py).
Kudu's frontend is substantially simpler, since its unit tests are statically linked binaries and thus do not have many dependencies and are simple to invoke.
