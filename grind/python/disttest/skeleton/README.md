The contents of this directory are used to bootstrap the test environment.

Because of the failings of bash, the skeleton environment is setup as follows:

cd /my/test/directory/
sh skeleton/unpack.sh
source skeleton/environment.source

This extracts the dependencies and adds them to your environment.
